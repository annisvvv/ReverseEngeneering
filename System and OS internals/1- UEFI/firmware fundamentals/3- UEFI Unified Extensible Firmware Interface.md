**UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface)** is modern motherboard firmware that replaces the traditional BIOS and runs immediately after a computer is powered on. Its role is to initialize and configure hardware, perform system checks, and then start the operating system, but it does so using a 32- or 64-bit architecture rather than BIOS’s 16-bit design. UEFI provides a modular and extensible environment with built-in drivers, a graphical setup interface, mouse support, and the ability to understand file systems. Instead of loading a tiny boot sector like BIOS, UEFI reads bootloader files from a dedicated EFI System Partition (ESP) on a disk formatted with GPT, allowing support for very large drives and faster boot times. It can also enforce security features such as Secure Boot, which verifies that the bootloader has not been tampered with before execution. After selecting and launching the appropriate bootloader, UEFI hands control to the operating system, which then takes over hardware management using its own drivers, making UEFI more flexible, secure, and scalable than legacy BIOS.
