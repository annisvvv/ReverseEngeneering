its a hard to get software because built in some dedicated storage which need additional tools to interact with it. 

considered part of the hardware and lowest level software.
# How it is stored
Not like other software firmware are stored in a separated chip on the mainbord like on SPI and the access to firmware code should be restricted.

For security some platforms may use built in firmware `boot rom` 

A program that loads the OS and called boot loader.

The firmware memory is freed after passing control to the boot loader or the OS.
