The **BIOS (Basic Input/Output System)** is low-level firmware stored on a chip on the motherboard that runs immediately when a computer is powered on. Its job is to initialize and test the hardware through the Power-On Self Test (POST), ensuring that essential components like the CPU, memory, storage, and keyboard are working correctly. After this, the BIOS configures basic hardware settings, provides minimal input/output services using simple, built-in routines, and allows the user to adjust system settings through the BIOS setup utility, with those settings saved in CMOS memory. Once the hardware is ready, the BIOS follows the configured boot order, locates a bootable device, loads the first sector of that device (the Master Boot Record) into memory, and transfers control to the bootloader, which then starts the operating system. Because BIOS operates in a very limited 16-bit mode and was designed for early PCs, it has significant limitations in speed, security, and hardware support, which is why it has largely been replaced by UEFI on modern systems.
