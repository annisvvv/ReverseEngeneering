This is equivalent to the shift left and shift right [[Bitwise operators]]. when a shift occurs the bits that are sort of hidden after the operation are stored in the CF carry flag. Where as the new bits are 0.

SAR shift arithmetic right can be explicitly used with the shift right operator if operands are signed

This have to do with the negativeness of the operand. SHR != SAR if value negative

SAL shift arithmetic left actually behave like the SHL
